Financial Database and Web Application
Welcome to our Financial Database and Web Application project README. In this project, we'll explore passive investing and build a financial database and a web application. We'll use SQL, Python, and the Voilà library to analyze the performance of a hypothetical fintech Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF).

Background
In recent years, passive investing has gained significant popularity in the world of finance. Passive investing involves investing in a diversified basket of assets known as an Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF). This approach eliminates the need for in-depth research on individual stocks or companies and reduces the risk associated with investing in a single stock. ETFs provide investors with greater diversification and are a key element of modern investment strategies.

What You're Creating
For this Challenge assignment, you will create the following deliverables:

Jupyter Notebook: Your notebook will include:

Analysis of ETF data stored in a SQL database.
Professionally styled and formatted interactive visualizations to gain insights into the ETF's performance.
Web Application: You will deploy your Jupyter notebook as a web application using the Voilà library. This application will enable users to interact with your analysis and explore the ETF's performance visually.

Screenshot or Video: Capture a screenshot or create a video demonstration of your web application created with Voilà.
